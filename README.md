# OpenToonz Third-Party Libraries

This repository provides precompiled third-party libraries (Libs and DLLs) required to build OpenToonz. It serves as a temporary workaround due to Git LFS quota limits in the main OpenToonz repository.

### How to Use

1. Download the ZIP file from the release section.
2. Extract the contents into the thirdparty folder of the OpenToonz repository.

### Licenses and Source Code

The source code and licenses for these libraries are available in the OpenToonz repository:
